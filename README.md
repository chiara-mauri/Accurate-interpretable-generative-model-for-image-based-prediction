# Interpretable-subject-level-prediciton

This repository contains both the Matlab and the Python version of the code. 

The code assumes that training data are provided in the following format: 
- trainAge.mat (for Matlab) or trainAge.npy (for Python) is an array of size (# of subjects, 1) with age of all training subjects;
- trainImages.mat (for Matlab) or trainImages.npy (for Python) is 4D array of size (# of subjects, image dimension 1, image dimension 2, image dimension 3) with images of all training subjects (nonlinearly registered to a common space).

Validation and testing data should be provided in the same way. 

NOTE: the Python code is now faster than the Matlab version, but it will be updated.
